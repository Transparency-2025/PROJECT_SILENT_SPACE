### **TIER 1: "The Scout" (Smartphone App)**

**Design Evolution: From Sketch to Screen**

This image illustrates the UI/UX design process. It begins with a low-fidelity hand-drawn wireframe to establish the basic layout and functionality. It then progresses to a digital wireframe for more precise placement of elements, and finally, to a high-fidelity mockup with a polished, dark-mode interface, icons, and branding. The final mockup is what would be presented to stakeholders and developers.

### **TIER 2: "The Hunter" (USB-C Dongle)**

**Design Evolution: From Component Layout to Prototype**

This image demonstrates the industrial design process for a hardware product. The left side shows a technical wireframe, or a "see-through" diagram, which is crucial for engineering to ensure all internal components—like the MEMS microphone, DSP chip, and secure element—fit within the device's form factor. The right side is a photorealistic render of the final prototype, showing the materials, textures, and the functioning LED indicator as it would appear in a real-world use case.

### **TIER 3: "The Sentry" (IoT Wall Plug)**

**Design Evolution: From Concept to Product**

For the "Sentry" device, the process starts with a simple concept sketch to explore the physical form and placement of external features like the microphone grille and status LED. The final image is a high-fidelity prototype render, showing the device as a clean, unobtrusive product placed in a realistic home environment, ready for marketing and user testing.
